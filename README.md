from comment_llm import CommentLLM

# Initialize the application
app = CommentLLM(openai_api_key="your-api-key")

# Scrape reviews
result = app.scrape_and_store_reviews(
    google_maps_url="https://maps.google.com/business-url",
    max_reviews=100
)

# Ask questions
response = app.ask_question(
    query="What do customers say about the service?",
    business_name="Restaurant Name"
)

print(response['response'])

# Get business analysis
analysis = app.get_business_analysis("Restaurant Name")
print(analysis['analysis'])

# Search reviews
reviews = app.search_reviews("food quality", n_results=5)
```

## Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **GoogleMapsScraper**: Uses Selenium to scrape reviews from Google Maps
2. **RAGSystem**: Manages vector embeddings and similarity search using ChromaDB
3. **LLMClient**: Interfaces with OpenAI's API for generating responses

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key (required) | - |
| `CHROMA_PERSIST_DIRECTORY` | ChromaDB storage directory | `./chroma_db` |
| `HEADLESS_BROWSER` | Run browser in headless mode | `true` |
| `CHROMEDRIVER_PATH` | Path to ChromeDriver | Auto-detected |

### Browser Requirements

Comment-LLM uses Selenium with Chrome for web scraping. Make sure you have:

- Chrome browser installed
- ChromeDriver installed (or use `webdriver-manager` for auto-installation)

## Features in Detail

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

- Uses sentence transformers for semantic embedding
- Stores reviews in ChromaDB vector database
- Retrieves relevant reviews based on question similarity
- Provides context to LLM for accurate responses

### Review Scraping

- Handles dynamic loading of Google Maps reviews
- Extracts reviewer name, rating, date, and review text
- Supports scrolling to load more reviews
- Robust error handling for various page layouts

### LLM Integration

- Uses OpenAI's GPT models for response generation
- Provides context-aware answers based on retrieved reviews
- Generates comprehensive business analysis reports
- Supports custom prompts and temperature settings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **ChromeDriver Issues**
   - Make sure ChromeDriver is installed and in PATH
   - Or specify path in `.env`: `CHROMEDRIVER_PATH=/path/to/chromedriver`

2. **Google Maps Access**
   - Some business pages may have anti-scraping measures
   - Try running with `--no-headless` to see what's happening
   - Ensure the URL is a valid Google Maps business page

3. **API Rate Limits**
   - OpenAI has rate limits on API calls
   - The system handles rate limiting gracefully
   - Consider upgrading your OpenAI plan for higher limits

4. **Memory Usage**
   - Large numbers of reviews may use significant memory
   - Consider processing in smaller batches
   - ChromaDB persists data to disk to manage memory
